### 🖼️ Demonstration

![demonstration1 GIF](/readme/gif/home-setting.gif)  
On the **home screen**, you can access the audio settings by clicking the **setting** button.  
The audio includes background music and sound effects for correct and incorrect answers.  
`(Audio files are located in /Gangtic-Phone/assets/audio.)`

<br>
<br>

![demonstration2 GIF](/readme/gif/home-waiting.gif)  
By clicking the **Create** button, you can create a room, and the **X** button allows you to delete it.  
Clicking on a room lets you enter it, but the game requires 4 players to proceed, so you'll need to wait until the room is full.  
Rooms with other players **_cannot be deleted_**, and rooms with already 4 players are **_not accessible_**.

<br>
<br>

![demonstration3 GIF](/readme/gif/enter-game.gif)  
Once **4 players** are in the room, it is changed to the **game screen**.  
The player who entered the room first becomes the initial quiz master(painter).  
Afterward, the role of the quiz master is passed to the player who answers correctly.

<br>
<br>

![demonstration4 GIF](/readme/gif/game.gif)  
The quiz master draws the answer on the sketchpad.  
This drawing is **visible to all players**, and they can submit their answers using the text-input field.  
If a player answers correctly, they take over as the next quiz master. If the answer is incorrect, a message indicating the wrong answer will appear.  
When one player answers correctly, the rest of the players are notified with a corresponding message.

<br>
<br>

![demonstration5 GIF](/readme/gif/game-result.gif)  
The game consists of a total of **5 rounds**.  
After the final round, it will be changed to the **result screen**, where players can view the result of the completed game.  
`(Result files are stored in /Gangtic-Phone/running_game/result_n.txt.)`  
Clicking the **Home** button returns players to the main screen, and the **Exit** button closes the program.
